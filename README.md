🕒 Analog Clock using Python Tkinter
📌 Project Overview

This project is a GUI-based Analog Clock built using Python and Tkinter.
It displays the current time, date, and day in real-time using an interactive analog design.
The clock also includes dynamic colors for the outer ring, date, and day to make the interface visually appealing.

This project was developed as part of my Internship Task.

🎯 Internship Task

Organization / Program: [Your Internship Name]

Task Title: Build a GUI-based Analog Clock in Python

Objective:

Learn GUI development with Tkinter

Use time, math, and random modules

Implement real-time updates

Practice event-driven programming

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python (3.8 or later)

Tkinter – GUI development

Time Module – To fetch real-time data

Math Module – To calculate angles of clock hands

Random Module – For dynamic colors

🚀 Setup & Installation
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Analog-Clock-Tkinter.git

2. Navigate to Project Directory
cd Analog-Clock-Tkinter

3. Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv


Activate it:

Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate


Mac/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


(You can also skip this step if you have Python pre-installed as we only used built-in libraries.)

▶️ How to Run

Run the following command in your terminal or IDE:

python clock.py


The Analog Clock GUI will open in a 400x400 Tkinter window.

✨ Features

✅ Real-time hour, minute, and second hands
✅ Dynamic outer ring colors
✅ Displays current date and day name
✅ Attractive Tkinter GUI design
✅ Lightweight & easy to customize

💡 Uses

Learn Tkinter GUI development

Understand trigonometry in programming

Practice real-time data updates

Can be used as a desktop analog clock app

🛠 Challenges Faced
Logical Challenges

Converting time values into angles using radians

Positioning clock hands accurately

Updating canvas without overlapping hands

Technical Challenges

Random colors caused flickering

Needed to delete old shapes before redrawing

Fixed window size for proper UI alignment

🔮 Future Enhancements

Add a digital clock mode

Allow theme customization

Make the GUI responsive

Add an alarm feature with sound
